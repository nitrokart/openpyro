# About OpenPyro Project #

The main idea of the project appeared in august 2009 when we failed to find available and open solution both for amateurs and professionals.

## Core objectives: ##

  * Designing an open source hardware system for pyromusical fireworks shooting available for amateur budget.
  * Popularization of modern technologies in the field of amateur and professional fireworks.
  * Raising security level of amateur fireworks.
  * Popularization of Open Sources Software and Open Sources Hardware development, initiating social network for the development of open digital systems for fireworks shooting and trick effects.

## Main tasks for the nearest future: ##
  * Designing and development of the current prototype device and publishing the electronic circuit licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0
  * Designing the source code firmware device licensed under GNU GPL.v3

## The latest release of code v0.3 ##

All Arduino the source code is compatible now to Arduino IDE 1.0.

Are available Arduino IDE to download with all libraries necessary for the project for Mac OS and Windows operating systems.

The electronic circuit and photo for manufacture of very simple OpenPyro\_Transmitter\_mini for SuperbFire control is added.

## The release of code v0.2 ##

First of all:
according to your wishes, we have altered circuitry of the 8 channel OpenPyro Field box, and now 10 channels in one device are available for you.

Secondly:
we are delighted to present an alternative version of OpenPyro Transmitter Light. Analyzing trends in the fireworks forums, we came to conclusion that many fans are interested in
shooting pyromusical fireworks by computer, as well getting ability to manage already acquired equipment. Particulary for this purpose OpenPyro Transmitter Light was designed.

Letâ€™s consider it in detail:
3 control protocols are available (selection by jumper): AlphaFire 12cues, SuperbFire 32cues and our own high-speed protocol OpenPyro. Fully compatible with the control program PyroIgnitionControl V1.4.1.

Easy to manufacture, this device will allow anyone to gather it at home and control 30 devices, 32 channels each (for SuperbFire 32cues) with a resolution of 0.4 sec, or 30 devices on OpenPyro Transmitter, 10cues each with discreteness of 0.05 sec. High speed and shooting accuracy is very important for pyromusical displays, so we recommend you use a protocol OpenPyro.

## The release of code v0.1 ##

Available on the following link http://code.google.com/p/openpyro/downloads/detail?name=openpyro.zip

To compile the code you necessary next library for Arduino:

1. VirtualWire http://www.open.com.au/mikem/arduino/VirtualWire-1.5.zip

2. RCSwitch http://code.google.com/p/rc-switch/downloads/detail?name=RCSwitch_1.1.zip&can=2&q=

3. Keypad http://arduino.cc/playground/uploads/Code/Keypad.zip

This release is available the source code of the transmitter and receiver for 8 channels, as well as the transmitter circuit.
